      DJ INFO
    </h1>
    <p class="text-[11px] leading-relaxed ">
      Fast talking, mullet sporting, career obsessed DJ Lazlow is a man who
      believes he is on the way to the top. He loves the rock and roll life
      style, although he doesn't actually live it, and worships every morning at
      his mirror. He stole the V-Rock gig off his best friend and is desperate
      to get rid of the Vulture and make sure the focus remains tightly on
      himself. He believes being on the radio is a one way ticket to all the
      riches and girls the world has to offer. Unfortunately, it seems his ego
      may be the death of his career in rock and roll. Only time will tell.
